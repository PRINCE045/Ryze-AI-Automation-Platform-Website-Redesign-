# Ryze — AI Automation Platform (Website Redesign)

# Overview
This project is a conceptual redesign of the Ryze AI website, focused on improving visual clarity, user experience, and perceived product maturity. The goal was to present Ryze as a modern, trustworthy AI SaaS platform, aligned with contemporary product design standards.
The redesign emphasizes clarity, restraint, and credibility rather than heavy visuals or marketing noise.

## Problem Statement
The original website communicated technical capability but lacked:
Clear visual hierarchy
Strong trust signals
Calm, readable layouts on dark UI
A premium, enterprise-ready feel
This redesign addresses those gaps while keeping the product’s core value intact.

# Design Goals
Clearly communicate what Ryze does and who it’s for
Improve readability on dark backgrounds
Establish trust through structure and content hierarchy
Keep the design modern, clean, and professional
Ensure responsiveness and accessibility
Use modular sections for scalability

# Key Sections
Hero Section – Clear value proposition with focused CTAs
Metrics / Credibility – Communicates scale and reliability
How Ryze Works – Simple, step-based explanation
Features – Scannable feature cards with clear benefits
Testimonials – Calm, text-first trust signals
Pricing Preview – Transparent pricing with a highlighted Pro plan
Footer – Minimal and non-distracting

# Design Decisions (Important)

Dark UI with restraint: Used contrast sparingly to avoid eye strain
Limited accent color: Orange is used only for emphasis and CTAs
Minimal animation: Motion supports understanding, not decoration
Text-first trust: Testimonials are intentionally simple and readable
One highlighted pricing plan: Guides decision-making without pressure
These decisions are inspired by modern AI SaaS products but are not direct copies.

# Tech Stack

Next.js (App Router)
React
Tailwind CSS
Framer Motion (for subtle animations)
